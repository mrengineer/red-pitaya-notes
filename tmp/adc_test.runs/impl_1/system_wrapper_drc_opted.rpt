REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 system_i/writer_0/inst/fifo_0/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_0 has an input control pin system_i/writer_0/inst/fifo_0/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_0/ENARDEN (net: system_i/writer_0/inst/fifo_0/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/ena) which is driven by a register (system_i/ADC_1/inst/m_axis_tvalid_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
